foundationStickyFooter
======================
The Sticky footer will use the HTML5 tag <footer> and make it "stick" to the bottom of the page.
Simply add in <footer></footer> to your webpage with your desired styled content inside the <footer> tag.
You may pre-style the <footer> in your css file. 
The stiky footer will remember your original styles if the page is not long enough to "stick" to the bottom of the page! Even after resize!
There are no requirements for CSS!
You don't even need a fixed height, or a wrapper!

It even works in mobile! Go on, check it out the demo!
